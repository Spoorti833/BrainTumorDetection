# BrainTumorDetection
Developed a deep learning–based brain tumor detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). MRI images are preprocessed, resized, and passed through the trained model to perform binary classification. The project leverages TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy to deliver accurate and efficient predictions.
